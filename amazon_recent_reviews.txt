Review: I’ve used these for years, they used to be amazing, but they changed the formula and now they don’t stick to your face at all. The edges are peeling up within minutes of application.

Review: I'm in my early 30s and still have the occasional blemish come up. Whiteheads, under-the-skin, you know.What sucks the most is the built up pressure, and I end up squeezing until my face hates me. OR pretending that "I'm gonna let it do its thing" until I end up squeezing it anyway, leaving my skin traumatized.While I'm doing my best to cover untouched zits up with these patches, I've also noticed that if I break skin (ow), wash the area, apply some antibiotic cream, then patch, healing time goes waaay down. Loving it so far.

Review: I used this on my kids on their bug bites and they stopped itching right away and went away! The size is a good size and it sticks nicely. Will definitely be using them for bug bites

Review: These are not medicated, nor do they do anymore than any other hydrocolloid bandage, yet they're approximately five times more than other patches. I had little success with these patches, but much better with another brand here. The fact that they advertise all over Amazon is the only reason I can think for having so many reviews (yes I fell for it). Experience says: spend less money on better patches from another brand.
