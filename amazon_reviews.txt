Review: These are the best pimple patches I have found and definitely worth the money. I saved money using the subscription. The other ones I have tried don’t stick or don’t pull anything up from the pimple. These have SAVED my skin. They do pull on your hair a little when removed but worth it. They are the perfect size to cover a pimple and sometimes multiple if they’re close enough.

Review: I used this on my kids on their bug bites and they stopped itching right away and went away! The size is a good size and it sticks nicely. Will definitely be using them for bug bites

Review: These work quite well and I’m pleasantly surprised as others don’t. Sometimes it’s better to buy name brand and this is one of them. Quantity could be more but now that I don’t need them all the time it lasts longer. Easy to apply And remove and they stick well overnight.

Review: I've been using these for a few months and they work so well. I usually wash my face and apply these at night on problem areas and the next morning there's a huge difference! Since I work from home, I also apply these during the day after my face has been washed.I also use these on bug bites and helps the itchiness go away and heals quicker.These are my go to patches.

Review: I have been buying these pimple patches for years for my daughter and myself. I won’t buy any other pimple patch. They stay put and are comfortable to wear. Very effective at drawing the pimple out.

Review: I am so surprised these actually work! They do not work immediately, but with some time on your face, like when you sleep, they work! They do not feel like they are going to fall off either. They are not terrible to take off in the morning, either.

Review: Love these. They blend into any skin tone and really do work. It just pulls the gunk out of whatever irritation you have.  Super easy to use  MAKE sure you pull from the very end and try not to let it roll or it won't lay flat. I like how they have different things sizes for each need.Use as directed and you're good to go.

Review: I'm in my early 30s and still have the occasional blemish come up. Whiteheads, under-the-skin, you know.What sucks the most is the built up pressure, and I end up squeezing until my face hates me. OR pretending that "I'm gonna let it do its thing" until I end up squeezing it anyway, leaving my skin traumatized.While I'm doing my best to cover untouched zits up with these patches, I've also noticed that if I break skin (ow), wash the area, apply some antibiotic cream, then patch, healing time goes waaay down. Loving it so far.

Review: I do think these are mildly overpriced for being basically tiny hydrocolloid bandages, and the amount you get per box, but I don't use them super often so it's probably easier on my wallet than someone who might need them more regularly.There's no way for this to not be a little gross, so forgive me, haha: I use them mostly when I've accidentally scratched a zit and it's burst/open, or when something is in the scabbing stage and I can't get myself to stop messing with it. I don't think they do anything special, but they keep the 'wound' covered and clean and more importantly they keep my fingers away.The patches are thin enough that they're almost impossible to feel once they're on. I wish they had a little more stickiness, because I feel like once you peel them off the sheet the little edge you grabbed is less adhesive than the rest, but I've never had problems with them just spontaneously falling off.All in all of you don't need to use these every night and only maybe a couple of times in a week or so, this is probably a good choice. Otherwise I'd stick to buying regular hydrocolloid bandages and trimming those down since you'll get more bang for your buck.

Review: I use this if I feel a zit coming or if one popped up super fast. It's so unbelievably satisfying when I pull it off and it's got the dots of gunk on it. I love the quality of the product. I have very sensitive skin and it never bothers me. It covers well and sticks the whole day. It's comfortable enough that there's been times I forget it's there. It's very easy to remove even if there's hair under it (like along the hairline or on eyebrows). I accidentally bought 2 boxes on Prime Day and I could've easily canceled it and bought just 1 but I knew I was going to use it because they are just that good.

Review: I’ve bought these for years now and love them! When I get a blemish, they go on at night at are either fully gone or mostly gone the next day. Sometimes I’ll wear it a second night and it’s as if nothing was there to begin with. Highly recommend! My husband even used them and he’s a super picky dude!

Review: These babies work! The whole family uses them (except my husband- no zits. Darn him).Just stick and sleep! And in the morning you’ll see what’s no longer inside your tiny little blemish.Sticks well. Thick enough to do the job. Pricey, though. (I’ve purchased similar for less money). Size is sufficient for all blemishes I’ve had.

Review: Helped with an ingrown hair that I've been dealing with for a few weeks. I put the patch on overnight and when I took it off in the morning I gave the bump a gentle squeeze, finally got the hair out and the puss that was accompanying it. Will try again to get the remainder of the puss out tonight.

Review: These pimple patches are great. I have tried a lot of different brands and always come back to these. They stick on well and stay on even better! Once they are on you can barley see them. If you use them on the right pimple it will pull a lot of stuff out. Be cautioned when you put them on open skin it will cause your skin to get a scab.

Review: What I like most about it is it keeps it covered and out of my mind so that I'm not picking at it. Which gives it time to heal and it seems like it's healing faster because I'm not picking at it. All in all that's good in itself. I'm sure that there are medicines in there that are doing the job but really it's just to keep your freaking hands off your face. LOL

Review: I love these Mighty Patches. They cover your blemish and it’s clear matte so no one even knows you have one on. I love that it protects the blemish from any outside dirt in the air.

Review: As long as you place these patches on a blemish that has a visible white top, they are like magic.  Peeling them off and seeing all the goop stuck on it is so satisfying.  Worth every penny.

Review: The product works pretty good, my expectations were too high so my reaction to the way it works was like “oh… yeah i like it”
